In seven European nations, A Comppany runs more than 3,000 pharmacies. It's store managers are currently required to forecast their daily sales up to six weeks in advance. Numerous factors, such as marketing, rivalry, state and federal holidays, seasonality, and location, affect store sales. The accuracy of the results can be highly variable because thousands of different managers are making sales predictions based on their own situations.

In this machine learning experiment, I forecasted daily sales for 1115 stores spread around Germany for the next six weeks. Store managers may develop efficient staff schedules that boost productivity and motivation by using accurate sales estimates. Store managers will be able to concentrate on what matters most to them—their clients and teams—by aiding the company in developing a reliable prediction model.
